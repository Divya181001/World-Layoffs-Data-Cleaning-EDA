# World Layoffs Data Cleaning and EDA Project




## Overview:

This project focuses on cleaning and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on world layoffs data using SQL. The dataset contains information about layoffs across different industries and regions, and the goal is to clean the data, perform data exploration, and derive insights to understand the patterns and trends in layoffs globally.


## Dataset Description:

Check out the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022?resource=download). The dataset consists of the following attributes:
 - company
 - industry
 - total_laid_off
 - percentage_laid_off
 - date
 - stage
 - country
 - funds_raised


## Tool Used:

- MySQL: MySQL is used as the relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and query the dataset.
- SQL: Structured Query Language is used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
## Steps:
- Data Cleaning: SQL queries are used to clean the raw data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): SQL queries and MySQL functions are utilized to perform exploratory data analysis, including summarizing key statistics, visualizing trends, and identifying patterns in the data.
## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the World Layoffs Data Cleaning and EDA Project has provided valuable insights into layoffs trends across industries and regions. Through thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, we have gained a deeper understanding of the patterns and factors influencing layoffs globally.
## Future Work:

- Advanced Analysis: Explore advanced analysis techniques such as predictive modeling or time series forecasting to predict future layoffs trends.

- Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using any BI tool like Power BI for instance.
